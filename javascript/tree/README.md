# Binary and BST

Basic implementation of a Binary and Binary Search Tree data structures.

[Binary Search Tree](./binarySearchTree.js)

## Challenge

### Node

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
[Node](./node.js)

### Binary Tree

Create a Binary Tree Class that has a root property and creates an empty tree when instantiated.

[Binary Tree](./binaryTree.js)

The class should contain a method for each of the depth-first traversals

* pre order
* in order
* post order

### Binary Search Tree

Create a Binary Search Tree Class that has a root property and creates an empty tree when instantiated.

The class should contain the following methods:

* add
  * Arguments: value
  * Return: nothing
  * Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

* contains
  * Arguments: value
  * Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
