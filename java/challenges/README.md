# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Write a function which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any built-in methods return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

Nested `for` loops, the first taking in the array of numbers and positioning each index as the last index of the empty array, and counting down from the index position with every loop through. The second loop iterates through the newly created and reverse array and prints it to the terminal.

# Shift an Array

## Challenge

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

Create a method which takes in an array and a number. Establish the required length of the output array by taking the length of the input array and adding 1. Then find the middle index of that new array by taking that established length and dividing by 2. Then create the output array with the established length. Then iterate over the length of that output array, and with iterations above and below the middle index, insert the values of the original array, and where the index matches the middle index insert the number the method takes in as an argument.

# Binary Search

## Challenge

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency

Created a method which takes as input a sorted `array` of ints, and an int `key` to be used as a search term.
Method instantiates a `low` value of 0 and a `high` value created from the length of the `input array -1`
Created `while loop` that runs while the `low` number is less than or equals to the `high` number. upon each iteration of the loop a `mid` point is calculated by summing the `low` and `high` values and dividing them by 1. Next it checks if the input `key` is equal to the value at the `mid` position of the input `array`. If so, the loop ends and that mid position value is returned. If not, the loop checks if the `key` is greater than the value at the `mid` position of the `array`. If so, it changes the `low` value by +1 to it and reiterating the loop. Otherwise the high value has it's value set to the mid value -1. If the key never finds it's match in the loop, it exits and returns -1.
