# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Write a function which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any built-in methods return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

Nested `for` loops, the first taking in the array of numbers and positioning each index as the last index of the empty array, and counting down from the index position with every loop through. The second loop iterates through the newly created and reverse array and prints it to the terminal.
